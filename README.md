# Django-Courses_API
This is a Simple Example of how to Create and Work with Django APIs. Here, we have simply added a list of courses which the API can access with GET method.

We use a simple <a href="https://github.com/n-rohit/Django-Courses_API/blob/main/courses/serializers.py">serializers.py</a> file to get the data from the <a href="https://github.com/n-rohit/Django-Courses_API/blob/main/courses/models.py">models.py</a> file and set it into respective fields like 'id', 'url', 'name', 'language' and 'price'.
